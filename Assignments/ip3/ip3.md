---

In this third individual deliverable, you will be given some more freedom in how your features are developed.

The objectives of this assignment are to:

- Investigate and understand a large, existing codebase
- Make changes that span the frontend and backend of a full-stack application
- Get experience with implementing features using the socket.io implementation of websocket
- (Optional) allow you a chance to get experience with working with large-language-model based tools for coding

In keeping with the last objective, **you may use code generation (i.e. "AI") tools in this assignment, with two caveats:**

- You are responsible for every line of code in your final submission. If we ask you questions about your submitted code and you are unable to explain why decisions were made because you accepted the LLM's suggestions without understanding them, **you will receive a failing grade on this assignment**.
- The PDF you hand in on Gradescope should document which LLM tools you used, how you used them, and whether you think the experience saved you time overall. (How much time did you spend on the assignment? How much time did the use of tools cost, or save? Did you go down any blind alleys or wild-goose chases due to your use of the tools you used?) This can be brief. Do not use text-generation to generate this text; your internal process of reflection and writing is the point.

## 1. Getting Started

Start by accepting our GitHub Classroom Invitation. It will create a Github repository for you which will include the starter code for this assignment. Run `npm install` in the root directory to fetch all dependencies for the `client`, `server`, and `shared` folders.

## 2. Recommendations When Working on the Project

1. Have the frontend and backend running, and have the project open in your browser, while you are working. It's very useful to have the website update as you make changes.
2. Frequently add and commit changes with git. This saves your changes and makes it easy to go back to a state where most tasks were complete, and is especially important when using tools that may be changing your code in unexpected ways.
3. Do not wait until the last minute to run `npm run lint` and `npm run check` to check for linter and typescript errors!
4. Follow the [debugging policy]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link debugging.md %}) to help in the debugging process.

## 3. Project Submission

You will submit your code by pushing the final version into your repository (add/commit/push). **All commits must be visible on the main branch on GitHub classroom to receive credit.** Be sure to check if the correct version is submitted before the deadline.

On Gradescope, you will submit a plain `.pdf` file containing three things:

1. A link to your project's GitHub repo (e.g. `https://github.com/neu-cs4530/ip3-robsimmons`) 
2. The short reflection on your (optional) use of LLM tools, as described in the project introduction

Grades will be assigned on Gradescope and synced to the Canvas Gradebook.

### TypeScript ESLint, Vitest, and Configuration Files

The GitHub project contains a number of configuration files you **may not modify**. The files `package.json`, `.prettierrc`, `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.mjs`, and `vite.config.mjs` are examples of configuration files, as is everything in the `.github` directory. If you change any of these files, take care to change them back; the list of changes in the feedback PR should not show any changes to these files. You also may not include `eslint-disable` commands to disable ESLint's checks in your final submission.

The code you submit must pass GitHub's automatic checks, which mostly just amount to the TypeScript typechecker, the ESLint linter, and the tests. You can run these yourself like this:

```
ip3-me $> npm run prettier
ip3-me $> npm run check
ip3-me $> npm run lint
ip3-me $> npm run test
```

When you push your code to GitHub, you can see the status icon for your most recent submission. It's initially a yellow circle, like this:

![image]({{site.baseurl}}{% link /Assignments/ip1/github-ci.png %})

After the tests run, this will turn into a red ❌ or a green ✅. Clicking on the icon will let you see details of the tests we ran.

The Actions tab on GitHub has the results of previous runs.

**Up to 25% of your total grade on the assignment may be deducted for CI failures (5% for Prettier failures, 10% for TypeScript failures, and 10% for ESLint failures). In severe cases we may decline to grade your assignment entirely. Give yourself sufficient time to find and fix any errors.** ESLint _warnings_ do not cause CI to fail and will not automatically lead to a deduction, but it is bad practice to have lots of console statements in your code, and this can lead to a point deduction if it makes it hard for a TA to understand your code.

## 4. Implementation Tasks

The implementation tasks are framed in terms of user stories and conditions of satisfaction. These user stories are quite a bit more narrow, specific, and focused than the user stories we expect for the group project.

### Task 1: A New Game Has Been Created!

User story: _As someone who leaves Game Nite open in the background while I'm at work, I want to be able to see when new games are created, so that I can be one of the first to join or watch._

For this task, you will extend the websocket interface of Game Nite in order to alert users to the presence of new games. 

![image]({{site.baseurl}}{% link /Assignments/ip3/threenew.png %})

These essential conditions of satisfaction form the minimum viable product:

 - 1.1: When a user creates a new game, any users watching the Game Nite home page will immediately see the new game inserted to the top of the list of games. 
 - 1.2: A new game appearing on the home page does not cause currently-visible games to be removed. This means that new games may cause more than four games to be visible on the home page. 
 - 1.3: When a user creates a new game, any users watching the "All games" page at `/games` see the new game inserted.
 - 1.4: On both the home page and list-of-games page, new games that have been added since page load have some attention-getting designation as new games. ("New!")
 - 1.5: When the user navigates to the home page or all games page, there are no games with the attention-getting new-game decoration.
 
For full credit, you should also implement these desirable conditions of satisfaction:

 - 1.6: Every browser session has a notional concept of "unviewed new games." If this count is non-zero, the "Games" sidebar item includes the count, for example by reading "Games (2 new!)"
 - 1.7: When a user starts a new game, their own count of unviewed new games does not increase.
 - 1.8: When the user is on the home page or the "All games" page, the count always stays zero.
 - 1.9: Navigating to or otherwise refreshing the home page or the "All games" page resets the count.
 - 1.10: When a user is *not* on the home page or "All games" page and another user starts a game, the count of unviewed new games increases.

Here is a scenario describing how these desirable conditions work:

1. User 1 and User 4 are playing a game of Nim. Their unviewed-new-game count is 0, so they see "Games" in the sidebar.
2. User 2 logs in. The are on the home page, and their unviewed-new-game count is 0.
3. User 3's unviewed-new-game count is 0, and they start a new game of Number Guesser. 
    - User 1 and User 4 have an unviewed-new-game count of 1. They see "Games (1 new!)" in their sidebar. (CoS 1.10)
    - User 2 has an unviewed-new-game count of 0 (CoS 1.8)
    - User 3 has an unviewed-new-game count of 0 (CoS 1.7)
4. User 4 visits the home page, which sets their unviewed-new-game count to 0. (CoS 1.9)

We will examine the style and quality of your code. For full credit, make sure:

 - Any modified or introduced functions have appropriately updated JSDoc comments.
 - You are using Socket.io and not polling to re-fetch the game list.
 - All code uses appropriate [code style]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link style.md %}).
 - Excessive repetition in React is avoided by creating new hooks or new components.

(This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.)

### Task 2: Profile Images

User story: _As a GameNite user, I want to set a profile image on my account so that other players can recognize me across the site._

For this task, you will extend the user profile to support a profile image hosted on an external image service, and display that image in the appropriate places across the frontend.

These essential conditions of satisfaction form the minimum viable product:

 - 2.1: A user can enter a URL pointing to an image hosted on an external service (e.g. postimages.org) into an input field on their profile page and click a Save button to persist it. (The Save button for profile image should operate independently of the existing display-name/password form.)
 - 2.2: After saving, the profile image is displayed on the user's profile page. (The image should be displayed at a reasonable size that does not break the page layout.)
 - 2.3: If no profile image URL has been saved, no broken image icon or empty placeholder space is shown, the image area is omitted from the profile page entirely.
 - 2.4: The profile image is visible to other users when they visit that user's profile page. To test this, add a clickable link on player names in the game panel that navigates to their profile page. (The profile page should display the profile of the user identified by the URL, not the logged-in user.)
 - 2.5: A user can clear their profile image by clicking a dedicated Remove button on their profile page, which deletes the saved URL and returns their profile to the no-image state described in 2.3.

For full credit, you should also implement these desirable conditions of satisfaction:

 - 2.6: Profile image appears next to the user's name in chat messages. If the user has no profile image set, no image or empty space appears in that location.
 - 2.7: Profile image appears next to player names in the game panel player roster. If the user has no profile image set, no image or empty space appears in that location.
 - 2.8: Profile image appears next to usernames in forum threads and comments. If the user has no profile image set, no image or empty space appears in that location.
 - 2.9: Updating or clearing a profile image does not log the user out. Hint: the profile image URL does not require re-authentication when changed.
 - 2.10: Profile images are displayed at a consistent, fixed size - chosen by the student — across all parts of the app where they appear.
 - 2.11: If a saved URL does not resolve to a valid image, no broken image icon is shown, the app handles this gracefully by hiding the image element.

Note: Image data (e.g. data URLs) must never be stored in the database, only a URL string pointing to an externally hosted image.

We will examine the style and quality of your code. For full credit, make sure:

 - Functions are added where appropriate and given good names and informative JSDoc comments.
 - All code uses appropriate [code style]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link style.md %}).
 - Excessive repetition in React is avoided by creating new hooks or new components.
 - The user data types in `server/src/models.ts` and `shared/src/user.types.ts`, and the function that constructs user objects when sending data to the client, indicate where changes are needed.
 - Not all existing update flows are appropriate models for new features, understand why existing hooks behave the way they do before using them as a model.

(This is not intended to be an exhaustive list.)

### Task 3: Testing

The starter code for this assignment includes Playwright end-to-end tests of login behavior and games. Pick a couple of your implemented conditions of satisfaction and create a new "end-to-end" test file that implements automated end-to-end tests of that new behavior. 

Your code should be readable and make it clear what testable conditions you are describing and which conditions of satisfaction these testable conditions relate to. There does not need to be a one-to-one relationship between testable conditions and Playwright tests: a single Playwright test can cover multiple testable conditions, and a testable condition can be covered by multiple Playwright tests.

Make sure that this new file gets added to your Git repository and pushed to GitHub!
